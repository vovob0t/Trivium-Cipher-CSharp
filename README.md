# Trivium-Cipher-CSharp
Implementation of the Trivium stream cipher in C#

I think the algorithm is done correct, but i have a feeling some of the transitions between numeral systems are off 
and that's causing answers that differ from other implementation that i tested. They happen to differ from one another too.

I have a suspicion that work with little and big endian in different languages causing the difference, but i may be wrong
